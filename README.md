# Customer Prioritization


The main objective of the project was to visualize the high-prioritized customers and low-prioritized customers using K-Means Clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we created a novel formula, namely, priority_value, to rank the customers. Secondly, the project was broadcasted to a website, wherein a  dataset is taken as an input and the customers are ranked based on their respective priority values. Also, additional features such as: top brands, spendings for each  customers are also shown.
